          <h3>The Initiative</h3>
          <p>An outreach program to bring STEM education to children from underprivileged socio-economic backgrounds. It started off with a few teaching sessions at government schools and expanded
            into Vidyaverse. We developed a practical applied and experimentational science based curriculum through interviews with children and experts in education and tested and implemented it with partner schools in
            low-income neighborhoods around the city. I also spearheaded the creation of a mobile app to make our educational resources accessible. Through our research process and interactions, the most
            rewarding part has been growing curiosity and seeing more children want to take up higher studies in science which once felt out of their reach.
